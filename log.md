# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 31, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Signed up and used https://codefights.com/

**Thoughts:** I found this to be an interesting application for giving coding puzzles in a nice and easy to use environment with tests to make sure that your solution works properly. It get the problem solving ideas rolling, but it isn't much of a real world project

### Day 2: June 1, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Started work on my fidget spinner web based incremental
game

**Thoughts:** I took a while getting started with this, running into small
problem with setting the project up. I haven't used html, css and javascript
for a while (since my last attempt at making an incremental game). Things will
be slow going while I work up my knowledge again. I got a thing to spin and
speed up as you click, which is pretty cool!

### Day 3: June 2, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: I moved some of my code around. Moved things to
functions and created classes for my spinners.

**Thoughts:** This wasn't too hard for today, and hopefully it will make things
easier in the future. This took longer than it probably needed to again because
I'm relearning javascript to some extent. I'm not looking forward to tomorrow
when I have to start writing some better html so I can include some more
buttons to upgrade my spinner.

### Day 4: June 3, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: I started to migrate over to using the Pixi framework for
creating my game.

**Thoughts:** As usual this was slower than I thought it would be, I have
higher expectations of how much I can achieve versus how much is actually
feasable to achieve. Pixi allows me to move away from worrying about HTML and
css so I can focus on the stuff I actually like with coding, and will allow me
to make full use WebGL with a nice wrapper.
