# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 31, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Signed up and used https://codefights.com/

**Thoughts:** I found this to be an interesting application for giving coding puzzles in a nice and easy to use environment with tests to make sure that your solution works properly. It get the problem solving ideas rolling, but it isn't much of a real world project

### Day 2: June 1, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Started work on my fidget spinner web based incremental
game

**Thoughts:** I took a while getting started with this, running into small
problem with setting the project up. I haven't used html, css and javascript
for a while (since my last attempt at making an incremental game). Things will
be slow going while I work up my knowledge again. I got a thing to spin and
speed up as you click, which is pretty cool!
